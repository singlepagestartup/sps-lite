# GitHub Codespaces

For GitHub Codespaces you need to add SSH key manually, only default codespace container connects to account automatically.

In started container run commands:

```
ssh -T git@github.com

The authenticity of host 'github.com (20.26.156.215)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

<!-- Type 'yes' -->
```

```
ls ~/.ssh

<!-- You will see something like that -->
ls: cannot access '/home/node/.ssh': No such file or directory
```

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"

<!-- You will see -->
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/node/.ssh/id_ed25519):
<!-- Type 'yes' -->

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
<!-- Press 'Enter' -->

Enter same passphrase again:
<!-- Press 'Enter' -->

The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
...
+----[SHA256]-----+

<!-- Your SSH key is generated -->
```

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

ssh-ed25519 ....
```
